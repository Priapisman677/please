-Add message to reset the tank settings
-Make the message disappear after a time. ( including the remove message button in 10 seconds).
  If I click the remove message button it should also disappear along with the message


-I also should make the buttons state what is the increase of speed that they could have as well as things as the speed limit specified for each tank.


Another feature that I could add is to have a fuel tank that will be specific for each tank and each time the tank performs a function the fuel could be reduced.



Other:
-Minerals that can be mined depending on the type of drill.

shop: Sell minerals and:
    -Global fuel reserve   (Decreases after every tank uses fuel).
    -buy fuel tanks
    -upgrade the tanks (increase their tier and buy features) very more complex I guess

-Inventory

-Tank factory (create your own tank)
